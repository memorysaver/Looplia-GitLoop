  "description": "How is AI affecting education? \n\nAt Anthropic, we often talk about “holding light and shade”: taking seriously both the benefits and the risks of the AI systems we’re building. In education, that trade-off is especially acute. AI offers the potential to scale up personalized learning, tutoring, and assessment, but it also invites some much more fundamental questions about how (and even what) students should learn. \n\nIn this video, four Anthropic staff members with deep personal ties to education discuss how they’re navigating this topic—at work and in their own lives, too.\n\n00:24 – Introduction\n1:15 – Why is Anthropic focused on this topic?\n5:47 – How is AI affecting education today?\n9:04 – What is the potential we see in AI for teaching and learning?\n13:42 – How should children and teachers approach learning in the age of AI?\n21:16 — What work is Anthropic doing in the sector?\n31:19 – What are the things we’re still uncertain about?\n38:20 – What would the successful incorporation of AI look like?",
