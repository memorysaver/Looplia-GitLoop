00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.799
Today, a lot of the emphasis is on how

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.262
frontier AI models are transforming
software engineering.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.473
What we're interested in
understanding is how

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:19.019
that can begin to translate
into the physical world.

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:24.399
Robotics is sort of the clear entry point
to how you have a mostly software system,

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.485
start having the ability
to reach out into the real world.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.118
Project Fetch is this self-contained experiment
where we wanted to measure

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:38.455
how much does Claude accelerate
humans performing

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:42.083
a fairly sophisticated technical task
that they do not have experience with?

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.211
Project Fetch was a one day experiment.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.629
The experiment was three phases.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.381
All of these tasks were shaped
approximately

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.134
like get this robot dog
to fetch a beach ball.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.260
There were two teams.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.429
These teams were comprised
of software engineers

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.266
and research engineers at Anthropic
that had hardly any robotics experience.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:01.227
One team had access to Claude
and the other team did not.

00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:04.939
Phase one was very simple.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.193
It was to use the pre-provided

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:12.739
controllers to get the dog
to walk out to a beach ball

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:16.785
and bring it back
to where it started.

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.161
Alright.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.288
I see. It's pretty intuitive.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.335
And we're supposed
to bring it over by the bone?

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:26.169
Yeah, I think.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:29.005
I think the team with Claude
took about seven minutes.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.593
Alright, go attack that team now.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:36.137
Go attack their dog. Charge!

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:38.056
Shoot, guys.
They’re destroying us.

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:40.600
Oh my god. Wait. We're getting,
we're getting destroyed.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:44.020
The team without Claude,
I think, took 10 minutes.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.562
Oh, sorry.

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:45.647
It's going to hit you.

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:50.110
Alright.
I'm going to do a victory dance.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:56.282
Phase two was also a game of fetch.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:02:01.454
But this time the teams had to program
their own controller.

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:05.750
You have to actually get access
to the hardware and design a program

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.878
that you can write on your laptop
that will control the dog.

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:12.912
Claude just like one-shotted a whole controller.

00:02:12.912 --> 00:02:15.039
Alright, I'll do some calisthenics.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.539
Nice, nice.

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.555
Is this for—
Oh, this is just control.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:19.764
But that's all we need I guess.

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:24.185
This is from the official ROS2 SDK,

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.980
and I got this installed,
but then it's asking for

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.983
a whole bunch of other packages,
and that's all failing.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.987
I've never really understood
how reliant I am on Claude

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:37.615
doing the menial work,
finding all the nitty gritty details

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:40.410
I don't want to have to figure out.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.495
We can't, we can't get nervous about them.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:45.790
You know what, I'm just going to install PIP
from the actual container later, so.

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.417
Oh wait. No, I can't.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.459
I know I'm impatient.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.003
It's been over a minute.

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:53.173
One of the primary bottlenecks of the
experiment is that you have this hardware,

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.301
you have this complicated
piece of technology, you have your laptop,

00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:00.221
and you have to, like,
get your laptop talking to this hardware.

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:05.393
I am setting my Claude up to create a dog
server that all of our computers

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:09.647
can connect to to see
what the dog is seeing.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.608
There are many different software
libraries on the internet

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.610
for communicating
with this particular robot,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.862
and Claude found these things
for them, it installed

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:20.575
the right things on their computer
and it pretty quickly got them access to the dog.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:21.600
Oh shit.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.972
So fast.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:27.540
Watch out.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.208
Careful now.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.835
Try not to run into the table.

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:34.214
Uh oh. Turn around.

00:03:35.343 --> 00:03:37.887
It has a mind of its own.
Turn it off, it's alive.

00:03:38.556 --> 00:03:39.881
Oh shit.

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:47.059
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

00:03:52.111 --> 00:03:55.489
I think that team should be disqualified
for hitting another participant.

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:59.697
The team with Claude finished
phase two in about 2 hours and 15 minutes.

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:04.535
Probably the area
where we saw the most uplift from Claude

00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:08.665
was just in the task
of connecting to the robot.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:13.962
We think that's really important
because it is, in fact, difficult

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:17.674
for anyone to identify

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:21.010
an arbitrary
piece of hardware in the world

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.264
and figure out how to talk to it
and how to control it.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.349
I think they got their camera.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.851
They got their camera working? Yeah. Shit.

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:30.687
Was Claude even helpful for this part?

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.939
Or are we just slow?

00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:34.983
Yeah.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.235
We're not getting very far,
but that's okay.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.528
It's a learning experience.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:39.696
The team without Claude

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:43.491
really struggled with this
and went down a lot of different paths.

00:04:43.574 --> 00:04:46.911
None of which were especially successful.

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:48.705
And we basically had to intervene
and be like,

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.249
alright, here, here is a strategy
that we know works.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:52.875
Start from there,
and then this will unlock

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.712
kind of the rest of the phase
and the rest of the experiment for them.

00:04:58.109 --> 00:04:59.168
Nice.

00:04:59.168 --> 00:04:59.668
Oh great.

00:05:00.653 --> 00:05:02.082
Uh, Daniel?

00:05:02.342 --> 00:05:04.087
Daniel or Kevin?

00:05:08.182 --> 00:05:13.104
Phase three of the experiment
was a greater degree of autonomy.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:17.233
The task in phase
three was to write a program

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:21.404
that would get the dog
to fetch a beach ball all by itself.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:26.200
Essentially, just press go
and have the robot search around, detect

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.206
the location of the ball, walk to the ball
and bring it back, all autonomously.

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:34.876
This is like ratcheting up in difficulty
kind of by design,

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:38.504
but also gesturing at the real problem
that we expect frontier models

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.715
having to solve in
the future is essentially

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.258
this kind of autonomous version
where, like

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.802
if a frontier model
wants a robot to do something for it,

00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:47.055
it needs to be able to
solve this very hard problem.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:52.852
The team without Claude in phase three

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:58.775
did a good job of the initial task of
coming up with a way

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:04.822
to track the location
of the robot in space.

00:06:04.822 --> 00:06:10.036
They made progress on the task
of detecting the ball,

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:14.791
but they didn't really come close
to knitting everything together.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.251
I miss Claude so much.

00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:20.088
The team with Claude actually came
fairly close to finishing phase three.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:21.172
I think by the end

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:24.092
the team with Claude was maybe an hour
and a half away from being done.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:28.471
The results of the experiment
were essentially that the team with Claude

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.807
completed all of the things that they did complete

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:33.810
in a couple of hours faster than the team
without Claude.

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.104
In the near term

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.022
we think that AI

00:06:38.022 --> 00:06:42.485
models are going to do exactly
what we showed in this experiment,

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:46.656
which is making it easier for people

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:51.619
without a lot of robotics experience
to engage meaningfully with robots.

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:55.373
Just with this one tool we have, we've
dramatically accelerated their ability

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:56.582
to do things with this robot.

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:59.377
We didn't go like train Claude
to uplift humans to do robotics tasks.

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:01.671
This is just a thing
that fell out of this technology.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:05.299
And then maybe in the long run,
this is kind of a leading

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:08.302
indicator of where the whole
the whole system is going.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:14.517
What today requires the combination
of a person and an AI model,

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:18.729
tomorrow is likely to just require the AI model.

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.732
The effects of AI are

00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:25.111
not just going to be in software,

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:29.657
they are going to be in hardware
and in the physical world as well.
