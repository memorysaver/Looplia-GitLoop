00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.084
Hey, I'm Sholto.

00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:03.545
I'm an engineer and researcher here
at Anthropic.

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:05.755
Claude Opus 4.5 is our best model yet.

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:07.632
It's the best in the world
at coding,

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:09.884
agentic tasks and everyday 
work like spreadsheets.

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:12.595
But what's harder to show
is how it just gets it.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:13.972
I trust this model more.

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.558
My time between interventions
keeps getting longer,

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:18.810
and I keep seeing colleagues
say it solved a bug that Sonnet

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.978
never could have found.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:21.438
The model is also more efficient

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:23.356
because it knows when 
to think before acting, 

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:24.774
so that it makes the right change.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:26.568
We’ve got this take home.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:28.987
It's a two hour
intensive engineering task.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:33.283
And in that time, the model scored higher
than any human ever has.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.035
It’s also much better at front end.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.329
It's way better at vision, and that
makes it a lot better at using computers.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.915
Opus 4.5 is available today.

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:44.169
For the first time,
it's on every major cloud platform.

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:45.378
Let us know what you think.
