00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:02.877
Analysts do this statically
in one Excel sheet

00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:06.297
that they refresh manually
every week, every quarter.

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:07.841
Instead of doing that,

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.760
BCI has instead used our Artifact feature

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.180
to connect directly to
S&amp;P and FactSet data sets

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.933
so that the artifact is a live dashboard

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.060
of how these metrics
compare against each other,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.312
and with one simple prompt to Claude,

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:22.772
you can easily update it,

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:24.399
and these artifacts are also shared

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.026
with their managing directors

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:29.904
who are directly interfacing
with these platforms as well.

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:31.781
So I think we're really seeing

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.950
not just acceleration of work,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.745
but a way for the work to
actually be transformed.

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.830
- Hey, my name's Alexander Bricken,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.707
and I lead our applied AI Engineering team

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.667
for Financial Services.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:44.210
Today, we're gonna be talking to you

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.795
about Claude for Finance,

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.464
and I'm joined by my colleague Nick.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.340
- Hey, my name is Nick Lin,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.053
and I lead product for Claude
for Financial Services.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.555
I'm also a recovering investment banker

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.223
and private equity investor.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.225
A lot of these problems
we're about to talk about

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.352
are very near and dear to my heart,

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:02.771
so I'm very excited, Alexander.

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:03.605
- Awesome.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:05.023
So, Nick, my first question for you is

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:07.817
how do you feel about the
shift in the AI landscape

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:09.402
for financial services these days?

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.488
- You know, I've been with Anthropic

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:14.324
for a little bit over
a year and a half now.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.367
That was before Claude 3,

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:18.787
so I think the enterprise AI landscape

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.622
has changed significantly,

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.582
especially in the past few months.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.125
What I am really noticing is that

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:28.838
there is a fundamental
shift from curiosity,

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:30.757
observing from the sidelines,

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:34.928
to actually starting to build
and deploy into production.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:38.515
Now, as we all know, coding
is one of the first products

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:40.308
and first domains within AI

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:42.560
with really strong product-market fit.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.145
I think we're starting to see this

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:47.607
really extend to other verticals
as well, including finance.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:51.402
For example, NBIM or the
Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund,

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:53.530
one of our largest customers,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.199
they have about 9,000 portfolio companies.

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:59.661
What they've done is they've
built integrations on their own

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:01.371
with things like model context protocol,

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:04.415
so that all of their portfolio managers

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:07.502
are querying these
integrations every single day

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.587
to get insights into their PortCos.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:11.756
So I think we're really starting to see

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:14.717
analysts spend a lot less time

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:17.595
on the mundane, manual,
tedious parts of the work,

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:20.515
and start to focus on what they
really care about, you know,

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.642
which is building relationships,

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:25.270
meeting with their customers,
and actually understanding

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.481
the business models of the
companies they're investing in.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.401
- Yeah, that really resonates
from my standpoint as well

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.862
as an applied AI person.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.697
Whenever I go and interact with customers,

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:38.491
a lot of the time, last year, let's say,

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.369
they would start with
building an AI chat feature.

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:43.580
Like, they'd have a bunch
of models represented,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.875
and they would select one,
maybe a random business user,

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.711
and they would try to work
with it and just chat with it.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:53.423
Eventually, now, we've seen
things like MCP come out

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:56.176
where the chat has become
so much more powerful.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.386
You can interact with the
systems you care about,

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:01.139
and I think that's really
exciting specifically for finance

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.058
because, often, there are
just so many product surfaces

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:05.768
that folks have to interact with.

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:06.686
- 100%.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.105
- If you give a model a tool these days,

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.232
often, the model's
intelligent enough to know

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.275
what that tool does

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.485
given the tool description
and the tool name,

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:17.238
but equally, the model has
certain primitives baked into it,

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:20.325
like the security that we try to bake into

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.327
the way the model
interacts with the world.

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:25.788
So we train our models to be
helpful, harmless, and honest,

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:27.874
and often, that's a reflection of

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.000
the data that they interpret

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.669
and the output that it
basically corresponds to.

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.671
So I think that's probably what
you're referring to as well

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.965
in that, like, the model
is generally intelligent,

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.176
and so if you give it
these different layers,

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.844
you can really see some cool results.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.888
- You know, safety is something
that you touched upon.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:45.350
That is so foundational
to everything we do.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.184
- Yeah.

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.852
- It's about securely
deploying these solutions

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:49.646
into enterprise environments.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:50.772
It's about making sure that

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.483
the models can accurately
answer the questions

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.444
with the right level of
understanding of those problems

00:03:56.444 --> 00:04:00.823
and fidelity, and third is
actually giving our users

00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:04.202
the trust, the verification,
the auditability

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:06.704
to understand these results.
So I think we think about

00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:08.248
all three of those components of safety.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.625
- Yeah, I mean, speaking of, right?

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:14.170
Anthropic was founded on
the principles of AI safety.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.339
It was a research org from scratch.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.173
I'm curious.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:19.926
How have we gone from being a research org

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:23.763
to releasing a distinguished
product in financial services?

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:28.768
- In my mind, Anthropic
really aims at building models

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.354
that can be safely deployed to solve

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:36.359
the most complex and difficult
problems in the world, right?

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:39.070
We're state-of-the-art
when it comes to code.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.783
0.5% of the world's population
are software engineers,

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.077
so that is just one sliver of

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:48.830
these really complex, difficult problems

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.957
we can really start solving, right?

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:53.376
They really exist everywhere
else in the world.

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:54.711
Code is so foundational

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.213
to every single part of a company, right?

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:59.340
It is how a company is run.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.261
So that means that
Claude is really great at

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:05.763
interacting with more complex systems,

00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:08.683
being able to expose its
thinking and its logic,

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.685
and that's why it's great
at finance as well, right?

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.562
Finance are complex problems

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.689
deployed into regulated verticals

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.400
that need verification, auditability,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.194
and ultimately, accuracy really matters.

00:05:20.194 --> 00:05:22.739
- Financial analysts these
days spend a lot of time

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.450
getting down to, like,
the pixel perfect level of

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.827
let's say a PowerPoint deck
or an Excel model, right?

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.704
You can't get anything wrong,

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:31.664
and it's funny, now that
we're in this paradigm

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:34.167
where models can do something similar,

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.794
but using the capabilities they have

00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:38.755
to write really structured logic,

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.214
and so that's actually what we've found

00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:43.343
language models to be good at,
what we've trained them on,

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.219
and that ability to do that,

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.638
it feels like it's just being abstracted

00:05:47.638 --> 00:05:49.349
into so many other domains,

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.975
like creating Excel spreadsheets

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.810
or like creating PowerPoints,

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.146
and so, yeah, it's just been, like,

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:58.066
super just kind of
striking, at least to me,

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.734
to see how many domains

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.903
the logic and reasoning of these models

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.488
actually ends up touching.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.573
- Ultimately, these are digital systems

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.909
that we interact with
every single day, right?

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.702
The fact that Claude is great at code

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:13.414
gives it a flexible skill and a shortcut

00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:16.542
to do all of these really cool,
interesting things, right?

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:20.046
Our file creation feature that
was launched a few weeks ago

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:23.174
that enables Claude to create
Excel documents and PowerPoint

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:26.719
is essentially Claude
accessing a virtual machine

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.181
within which it can run
Python code at scale

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:33.643
to edit, analyze, and
create Excel documents

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:36.312
and create these perfect DCF models,

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:37.897
which I think is super
exciting for us, right?

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:40.358
So I think there's a lot of other domains

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.819
that code can start really unlocking.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.071
- What's different to Claude for Finance

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.949
versus other products on the
market in financial services?

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.701
- You know, there are three
verbs I think about a lot

00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:54.455
that governs what I want to
build for Claude for Finance,

00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:59.085
and these are retrieve,
analyze, and create.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.670
Starting with retrieval,

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.713
many of the research agents on the market

00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:05.049
has seen, you know, quite
a lot of maturity, right?

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:07.885
Large language models are
fantastic at digging into

00:07:07.885 --> 00:07:10.513
large pools of data
and gathering insights,

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:11.347
and can read, you know,

00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:13.474
5,000 probably times faster than humans,

00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:15.726
but what we want to do with finance is

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:18.104
making sure that these
systems can connect to

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:22.024
all of the core data sources
that finance analysts work in.

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:26.154
In finance, the ability
to uncover insights

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.990
faster than your
competitors and your peers,

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.700
that's a really key advantage.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.243
Now, downstream from that,

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:34.120
it's great that we can
retrieve this information

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.624
and connect to it, but the
ability to do analysis at scale,

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:41.544
either through code or
through spreadsheets,

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.045
is so foundational as well.

00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:44.213
Financial models themselves,

00:07:44.213 --> 00:07:48.217
they're not just these
beautiful Excel sheets, right?

00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:50.136
They're a way for finance analysts

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:54.182
to inject their own judgment
of what the future looks like

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.933
and what the proper valuation looks like

00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:57.226
for that company, right?

00:07:57.226 --> 00:08:00.062
So, with that in mind, we want
Claude to be really good at

00:08:00.062 --> 00:08:02.273
understanding these core finance concepts

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:05.568
and manipulate systems
like Excel and spreadsheets

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.361
to be able to do that calculation.

00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:10.072
And then the third part
is creation, right?

00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:13.868
We're all social creatures
within the enterprise, right?

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:16.662
We do our work to be shared with others,

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:19.874
so the outputs themselves
in the form of spreadsheets,

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.543
you know, PowerPoint documents, Word,

00:08:22.543 --> 00:08:26.881
doing this in a way that is
client-ready, boardroom-ready,

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:28.132
is really important.

00:08:28.132 --> 00:08:30.551
So we really want to start
pushing Claude's capabilities

00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:32.261
to be able to do that as well

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:36.933
so that it is an end-to-end
agentic autonomous system.

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:37.767
- That makes a lot of sense.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.727
I feel like we build these primitives

00:08:39.727 --> 00:08:41.687
and then they almost end up snowballing.

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:44.023
So you have, like, the
retrieval step, right?

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:47.193
You build an MCP server
to connect to one system,

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.070
but then if you take the
data from that system,

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.280
maybe it connects to some
other system in a unique way.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.950
Like, you get data from
Snowflake, let's say.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.451
You find an ID in there

00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:58.120
and you need to connect it
to your Salesforce instance.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.248
You can easily do that with
some of those primitives

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:02.458
that we've built on the retrieval side,

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:04.210
but then it sort of continues to snowball.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.047
You get analysis where Claude
can write a bunch of code

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:11.217
and essentially piece together
some of that information,

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:13.302
and then finally the creation is

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:14.679
even take that one step further

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:17.014
and put it into the environment
that someone cares about,

00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:20.726
sending that post request,
back to the API example,

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:24.855
to a system where an analyst
or an operator can see

00:09:24.855 --> 00:09:26.816
the information that Claude
has reasoned through.

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:28.526
- So let's talk a little bit more about

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:30.361
what is actually Claude for Finance?

00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:32.446
How does it work? What
makes it so special?

00:09:32.446 --> 00:09:34.407
- So there are three layers

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.909
that we think about in our solution.

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:40.329
The models, the agentic
capabilities, and the platform,

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:42.456
starting with the models themselves.

00:09:42.456 --> 00:09:46.252
Fundamentally, we are
a research lab, right?

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.671
Everything we do really
aims at making Claude

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:51.465
the best model for financial services.

00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:53.092
Now, finance presents

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:55.970
some interesting challenges to us, right?

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.055
Code is something that we
can test every single day

00:09:58.055 --> 00:10:00.224
as software engineers
and product managers,

00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:02.518
but there are very few investment bankers

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:04.312
within these four walls of Anthropic.

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:07.398
So here's where we're
really excited to work with

00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:12.403
early customers like BCI,
Perella Weinberg, and NBIM,

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:13.613
to really let us know,

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.698
what are the use cases
they really care about?

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:17.366
What does good look like?

00:10:17.366 --> 00:10:21.370
And then help us, much more
importantly, uncover those gaps

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.081
that we can bring back
into the research process.

00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:26.959
The second thing is on
the product side, right?

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:30.421
Agentic capabilities are
essentially the code that we write

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:33.466
to enable users to
interact with the models.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.177
We've built capabilities
like deep research.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:40.056
Now, we're really investing
in being able to embed Claude

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.558
in all of the core surfaces you work in,

00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:45.144
not just Claude for
Enterprise or Claude.ai

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:49.690
but also the browser
extension, Excel, Chrome,

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.775
and other surfaces

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.943
that our analysts and enterprise customers

00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:54.362
work with every single day.

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.572
The last piece is we want to, again,

00:10:56.572 --> 00:10:58.366
build a really flexible platform

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:00.826
that can be tailored and deployed

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:03.120
very easily for our customers.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.789
That's why we've been
spending a lot of time

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:08.751
with industry partners like
S&amp;P, FactSet, PitchBook,

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.252
to build these integrations

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:13.422
so that these agents can
be as powerful as possible.

00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:15.800
- So I'm curious. How
has adoption been, right?

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.511
Who's using this? Why are
they excited about it?

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:19.345
Walk us through that.

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:21.055
- As I mentioned before,
we're really seeing

00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:24.767
pockets of adoption across
the entire industry.

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:25.976
I'm often asked, you know,

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:30.106
which sub-verticals do you
see AI adoption in in finance?

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.775
I think it's much less
about sub-verticals,

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:36.195
but much more about the
culture that our customers

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:38.155
have really engendered, right?

00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:39.949
Which requires a good combination of

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:44.787
top-down encouragement and
adoption to lower the barriers,

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:48.457
but also a bottoms-up
experimentation culture, right?

00:11:48.457 --> 00:11:50.042
To try all of these tools out there

00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:52.128
to figure out what makes sense.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.714
With that in mind, I think
some of the main customers

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:59.135
that we've seen strong adoption
from, BCI, for example,

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:02.430
they've sort of fundamentally
transformed the way they work.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.473
There are these things
called comps analysis

00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:05.683
that analysts do,

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:09.729
which basically means
you're comparing comps,

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.313
financial and operational metrics

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:12.606
for all of these different companies,

00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:15.776
to figure out whether they're
trading at the right value.

00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:18.571
Analysts do this statically
in one Excel sheet

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.991
that they refresh manually
every week, every quarter.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.493
Instead of doing that,

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:27.413
BCI has instead used our Artifact feature

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.833
to connect directly to
S&amp;P and FactSet data sets

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:33.586
so that the artifact is a live dashboard

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.713
of how these metrics
compare against each other,

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:37.965
and with one simple prompt to Claude,

00:12:37.965 --> 00:12:39.425
you can easily update it,

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.051
and these artifacts are also shared

00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:42.678
with their managing directors

00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:46.557
who are directly interfacing
with these platforms as well.

00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:48.434
So I think we're really seeing

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:50.603
not just acceleration of work,

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:53.898
but a way for the work to
actually be transformed.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.692
- Memory is such an a fundamental piece of

00:12:56.692 --> 00:12:58.694
how humans basically
exist in the world, right?

00:12:58.694 --> 00:13:00.279
You have to memorize things to, like,

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:02.323
know where you put your
keys last, for example.

00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:05.451
How are we building that into our models

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:07.995
and why is that important
for financial services?

00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:09.705
- The way that we think about

00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:12.374
how we work with our customers,
as I mentioned before,

00:13:12.374 --> 00:13:15.461
there's very little that
we can internally test

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:16.962
for these finance use cases.
- Right.

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:18.506
- Is to, again, work really closely

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.716
with enterprise customers to understand

00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:22.802
where things are working and
where they're not, right?

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:25.846
And memory systems is something
that's really important

00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:29.016
to allow Claude to understand
and maintain context

00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:32.144
across all of these
different tools and surfaces

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:33.062
that it works in.

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:37.566
Claude is in Claude.ai,
in Excel, in the browser,

00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:40.069
interacting with FactSet, S&amp;P,

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:42.488
the ability to understand patterns,

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:45.866
understand preferences for
that, you know, DCF template

00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:47.243
that you want Claude to remember.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:48.494
All of these things are really important

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:51.539
to just make sure that
Claude stays, and in turn,

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.749
that continually gets better

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:54.959
through its interactions with you.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.460
- And so, like, over time,

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.170
you can imagine someone
prompting the model, like,

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.673
"Hey, you got this
formula slightly wrong,"

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:03.175
and then Claude has some
way of storing that memory,

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:06.887
whether it be a file system
or it's implicit, et cetera,

00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:08.556
which is pretty awesome.
- Yeah.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:09.515
- I'm excited for that.

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:12.226
- Or if, you know, the user and analyst

00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:13.978
really wants to use S&amp;P

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:17.273
for a specific piece
of EBITDA calculation,

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.149
Claude will actually remember
those preferences too,

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:21.277
just, like, you know, a good intern would.

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.863
- Cool. So we've talked a
lot about Claude for Finance.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.239
I'm curious, in your opinion,

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:27.658
what's next for our
product and research orgs

00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:30.411
in relation to making
Claude better for finance?

00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:32.121
- Yeah, you know, taking a step back,

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:35.708
Anthropic is enterprise
focused, enterprise first.

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:39.837
The only way for us to deliver
outcomes to the enterprise

00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:42.006
is to focus on specific domains.

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:45.175
Finance is one of the most
important domains for Anthropic

00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:47.636
across the entire stack.

00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:50.431
Research, product, and go to market.

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:53.726
Starting with research, we're
finally starting to invest in

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:58.731
both specific pre-training
and post-training for finance.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.776
On the product side, three
things I'm really excited about.

00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:07.740
One is going much deeper
into specific sub-verticals.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.618
Private equity has very
different needs from hedge funds

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:13.078
and insurance firms and investment banks.

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:15.289
We want to really start
understanding and peeling back

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:16.916
the nuances of those workflows

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:20.669
and make sure that the
components we're building

00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:22.338
fully serve those workflows.

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:23.422
We're also excited about

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:26.550
the ability to have
Claude everywhere, right?

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.885
Not just in the browser,

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:30.596
but within Excel, within PowerPoint.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:33.557
On PowerPoint and Excel, I think
we still have a lot of room

00:15:33.557 --> 00:15:36.226
to improve the quality of those outputs.

00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:39.229
So, excited to work again
really closely with research

00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:41.523
and bring these capabilities
into the product.

00:15:41.523 --> 00:15:44.568
On the partnership side,
it's really important for us

00:15:44.568 --> 00:15:46.820
to work closely with the industry.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.365
It's been really encouraging
to see the fact that

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:52.326
MCP servers have only
been out for six months,

00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:55.537
and major industry leaders
like S&amp;P and FactSet

00:15:55.537 --> 00:15:56.956
have already published

00:15:56.956 --> 00:16:00.501
functional, great versions
of their own MCP servers.

00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:03.462
We want to keep bringing
the industry together,

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:05.923
including some of the recent
announcements we've made.

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:07.508
The last piece is

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:11.053
working really closely with our
enterprise customers, right?

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:14.890
Fundamentally, that's how
we work together, right?

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.184
To translate what their needs are

00:16:17.184 --> 00:16:20.229
and help us build the research
and product capabilities

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:21.188
to meet those needs.

00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:22.106
- I definitely agree with that,

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.108
because not everyone comes from

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:26.235
a financial services background
like you at Anthropic,

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:28.445
and so I feel like we learn the most

00:16:28.445 --> 00:16:30.614
from the customers that
we're going deep with,

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:34.159
specifically when they're
designing evals, for example.

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:35.744
That gives us so much signal about

00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:37.955
how the model actually
works in production,

00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:40.582
and I think that level of collaboration is

00:16:40.582 --> 00:16:43.210
what we're going after
with Claude for Finance.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.128
- I think that's the main thing

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:47.339
I would encourage our enterprise
customers to think about.

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:50.634
You know, evals sound like
these mystical concepts,

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:51.677
but they're really simple.

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:56.265
They are tasks you care about
and problems you wanna solve,

00:16:56.265 --> 00:17:00.060
and an articulation of what
good looks like for those tasks.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.146
It's really important
for enterprise customers

00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:05.607
to be thoughtful about these problems

00:17:05.607 --> 00:17:06.567
rather than thinking about,

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:09.653
"Oh, I need to infuse AI into
every part of my business,"

00:17:09.653 --> 00:17:10.612
and that's how we can partner

00:17:10.612 --> 00:17:12.489
really closely with enterprise customers.

00:17:12.489 --> 00:17:15.534
We bring those evals directly
into the training process,

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:17.327
directly into the product pipeline,

00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:20.414
so that we can deliver these
capabilities to our customers.

00:17:20.414 --> 00:17:22.791
- 100%. Well, thank you so much, Nick.

00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:25.252
This was fantastic. I
appreciate you taking the time.

00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:26.587
- Thanks for having me, Alexander.
