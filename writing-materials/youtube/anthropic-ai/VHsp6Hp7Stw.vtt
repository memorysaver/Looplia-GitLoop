00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:14.160
You had an idea. It started yesterday with a&nbsp;
glimmer. What was it? Right. Claude remembered&nbsp;it.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:25.520
Your idea was hungry. Hungry for answers&nbsp;
and connections. Claude helped you look,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:38.000
reading alongside you. Turn this into&nbsp;
what? A deck, spreadsheets, documents,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.120
the tedious parts handled. Your idea stopped&nbsp;
being just words and slides. It became entries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:58.640
updates, actions, real things in real places.&nbsp;
You kept going. You left your desk. Your idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:09.600
followed into your phone. Calendar for when,&nbsp;
maps for where, reminders for later. By evening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:23.040
it was done. The idea was always yours. With&nbsp;
Claude as your thinking partner, you made it real.
